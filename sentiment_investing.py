#COMMENT: We will use a X (formerly Twitter) based sentiment strategy. It relies on user sentiments towards certain stock prices, or markets in general. 

# TODO:
# 1. We will load NASDAQ stocks twitter sentiments data
# 2. Calculate a quantitative feature of the engagement ratio on Twitter for each stock
# 3. For every month, rank all stocks and construct an equal-weight portfolio
# 4. Compare it against NASDAQ performance
